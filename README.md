RichJson acts as an extension to the JSON format. It allows you to reference data from other JSON files/folders, in order to keep your game's data modular and organized.

* You can reference other json objects/values as you whish, in any given file
* It supports multiple inheritence, constructor calls, interfaces and even nested string interpolations!
* Together with the raptor Skin System you can inject your game data loosely coupled and very modular.
* And it supports raptor features like: Scribble, Collage and scriptor.
